- Module concept
	- _**> go mod init .**_
	- creates go.mod which specifies project name and go version to run...
	- _**> go build**_
		- command used to build and bundle executable  app
	- > _**package main**_
		-  indicates entry point 
- Pointers
	- ![[Pasted image 20240625185706.png]]
- Functions
	- ![[Pasted image 20240626081216.png]]
	- returned variable names defined in return type definition
	- _**> return**_ reserved word alone since returned var names defined
- ![[Pasted image 20240626160036.png]]
	- _ is used to avoid using a returned variable without getting an error
- ### go.mod == package.json
	- Describes _**required**_ libraries
		- installed using go get
		- go get -> npm install
- ## Pointers
	- Exact memory address of the variable
	- ==avoid var copy== when function runs
		- use memory address instead
		- mainly used for big ass numbers
		- ==directly mutate== code using its address
	- Same value, different memory address... ->**_copy created**_:![[Pasted image 20240626171731.png]]
	- Pointer is *int type
	- Access value in pointer: ![[Pasted image 20240626172026.png]]
	- default value for pointers -> nil
- ## Interface
	- A set of conditions that allow Structs to have generalPurpouse names for functions without colliding with other structs
	- Concize function names and clearly defined types of structs and its must-have generic methods they share between

- ## Generics
	- Same function can accept & return different defined types
		- depending on provided values:
		- ![[Pasted image 20240627183411.png]]
		- Alternative to "any || interface{}" since it can accept almost any type as long as it is defined in [T type | type ] array.
		- Variable type:![[Pasted image 20240627183629.png]]
- ## Functions  as Parameters
	- This allows simple reusable functions where if a nested function is needed, it can be optimized to accept multiple.
		- ![[Pasted image 20240628083318.png]]
		- Custom type (transformFn) also used to simplify code
- ## Functions as return type:
	- Allows flexibility so you can logically handle a scenario where you have to dynamically return different functions for a use case 
- ## Concurrency / Go Rutines
	- Basically indicate when code execution should be handled differently
		- <-value // reference value to handle rutines execution indicators
