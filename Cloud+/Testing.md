## Vulnerability Testing
- Available exploits
- Scan ports & Generate reports
- Monitoring suspicious activity
- ### Pen Testing
	- Identify Vulnerabilities
	- Networking Scanning
	- Attack Software:
		- Metasploit
	- Proper Procedures
		- Permission 
		- Action
		- Report
## Performance Testing
- Load Testing
	- Demand
		- Ensures cloud services will handle all demand by stress testing it
		- SmartBear LoadNinja - Tool for load testing components
- Stress Testing
	- Max out capabilities of the system
- Capacity Testing
	- Gradually increasing demand on the server 
- Endurance Testing
## Regression Testing
- Ensures that pdates don't crash the solution
- Steps:
	- Identify the scope
	- Develop & Execute test cases and/or scripts
	- Report issues or bugs
	- Resolve and verify resolutions
- On every update:
	- Verify existing code is not affected
	- Every possible new-feature related code must be unitesting
	- New bugs or colissions
# Test Analysis

- ### Success Factor Indicators
	- *Should be included in tje report initally
		- Sizing 
		- Performance
		- Availability
		- Connectivity
		- Data Integrity
		- Proper Functionality
- ## Testing Actions
	- Baseline comparison
	- Service Level Agreement
	- Identify Cloud performance fluctuation
		- Latency Variables
		- Processing speed variables
	- **Document results.
- ## Baseline Confirmation Metrics
	- CPU usage
	- RAM usage
	- Storage Usage
	- OS and application versions and patch lvls
	- Network Utilization
	- Auditing Configuration
	- Managamennt Tool Compliance
- ## Compare Baseline vs Actual
