- ## CASB - Cloud Access Security Brokers
	- Provide visibility and control  over the use of Cloud Services, they provide:
		1. Data protection
		2. Access Control
		3. Compliance
		4. Threat detection and response
- ## Identity Authentication and Authorization
	- ### AAA:
		- Authentication
		- Authorization
		- Accounting
			- Logging what you do
- ## Tunneling Solutions
	- Enca
	- ssh
	- Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)
		- use IPSec for encryption, else no encryption
	- PPTP - Point to Point Tunneling Protocol
		- disappearing in the future
	- GRE - Generic Routing Encapsulation
		- wireless communication
			- All data that goes to a WAP (wireless access point)
				- tunneled through GRE back2  the controller 
			- de-encapsulates data
			- decides where it needs to go
- ## Firewalls
	- Portbased
		- allowed/disallowed ports
		- IP add filtering
	- Stateful
		- Internal Network -> Internet
		- Remembers the state so communications are possible
	- In the Cloud
		- firewall service
		- Virtual Server Instance
- ## Antivirus
	- Cloud antivirus
		- encrypts file and analyzes in cloud
	- Host based IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention System )
- ## DNS Security
	- ### DNS Security (DNSSEC)
		- DoT (DNS over TLS)
		- DoHTTPS (DNS over HTTPS)
- ## NTP (TCP[123])
	- Sync clocks for comp devices
- ## Other Devices
	- ADC (Application Delivery Controller)
		- Networking device to optimize and distribute the application
			- ALB
			- Application Accelerator
	- Packet Brokers
	- Capture filter and dist network traffic to monitoring tools
- ## User permissions
	- #### DAC (Discretionary Access Control)
		- Both User & Admin are in chrage of security and permissions
		- typical in small networks
	- #### MAC (Mandatory Access Control)
		- Security admin 
		- Roles
		- Central Authrity determines the acess
- ## Scanners
	- Port Scanners
		- Nmap, Masscan, Angry IP Scanner
	- Vulnerablity Scanners
		- Nessus, Open VAS, Qualys
