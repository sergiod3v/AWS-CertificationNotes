Agility to recover from failures, dynamically provission computing resources to meet demand, mitigate disruptions, miscongifugrations or network issues

### Principles:
- Test Recovery Procedures: Use automation to simulate different failures to recreate scenarios that led/would lead to failures before/in the future
- Use autoscaling everywhere you can in case the system overloads 
- Scaling horizontally usually better
- Automation to make changes to infrastructure
