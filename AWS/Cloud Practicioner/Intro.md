AWS Access options

Access key: you basically have 2 keys, one "sharable" and the other one is not, the secret access key is like the biggest one directly attached to your root account, not sharable, the other one depends on an user fo example

CLI: interact with services from command line

AWS SDK: depending on language, to embed in applications

-**CLoudShell**-
The aws cli inside of AWS itself so you dont have to use desktop

Roles
You can attach roles to services to control the permissions they have, for user instead, every user should have a group and a policy attached to it so it separates the user properly
