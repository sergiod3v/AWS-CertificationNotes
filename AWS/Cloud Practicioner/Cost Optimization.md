This pillar focuses on running systems at the lowest price point while delivering business value.

**Design Principles:**
- **Pay-as-you-go model:** Only pay for the resources you use.
- **Measure efficiency:** Use CloudWatch to track resource utilization and identify cost-saving opportunities.
- **Focus on application development:** Offload infrastructure management to AWS, allowing you to concentrate on core business projects.
- **Track and allocate costs:** Utilize tags to accurately identify resource usage and associated costs. This transparency helps measure ROI.
- **Leverage managed services:** Managed services leverage cloud economies of scale, often offering lower costs per transaction or service compared to self-managed solutions.
