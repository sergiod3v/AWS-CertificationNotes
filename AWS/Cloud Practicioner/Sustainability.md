The sustainability pillar focuses on minimizing the environmental impacts of running cloud workloads.

**Design Principles:**

- **Understand your impact:** Establish performance indicators to evaluate improvements in resource efficiency.
- **Establish sustainability goals:** Set long-term goals for each workload, considering return on investment (ROI).
- **Maximize utilization:** Right-size each workload to optimize hardware efficiency and minimize idle resources.
- **Embrace innovation:** Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings. Design for flexibility to integrate new technologies.
- **Leverage managed services:** Utilize shared services to reduce infrastructure needs. Managed services can automate best practices like data storage optimization and dynamic compute scaling.
- **Reduce downstream impact:** Design your cloud workloads to minimize energy consumption and resource requirements for users. This can help reduce the need for user device upgrades.
