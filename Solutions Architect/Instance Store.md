- ### EBS Snapshot archive
	- 75%cheaper
	- 24-72h to retrieve
- ### Instance
	- Extreme performance (IOPS)
	- Direct with the instance
	- Data lost if stopped
- ### EBS Volume Types
	- #AssosiateExam
	- gp2/gp3: general ssd best price/performance
		- can independetly set input/output speed separately 
	- io1/io2 Block Express: Highest performance SSD
		- input/output speed set together
		- low-latency/high throughput workloads
	- Volumes characterized in size/throughput/IOPS
	- **only gp2/gp3/io1/io2 can be used as boot volumes**
	- ==Provisioned IOPS==:
		- Critical business apps sustained IOPS performance
		- Apps that need > 16k IOPS
		- Databases workloads (sensitive to storage performance anc consistency)
- ### EBS MultiAttach!!
	- only io1/io2
	- full r/w high performance
	- AZ SPECIFIC
	- Up to 16 EC2 #AssosiateExam 
- ### EBS Encryption
	- Leverages keys from KMS
	- Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted
	- encrypted snapthot -> encrypted volume if created from it
- ### EFS
	- Use security groups to control access to EFS
	- Only Linux compatible (instance image)
	- encryption at rest using kms
	- POSIX file system
	- Classes:
		- Scale:
		- Performance
		- Throughput
			- Bursting
			- Provisioned
			- Elastic
	- Tiers -> Lifecycle just like s3
	- Very fucking cool dbajhdbhja
	- Inspect instance local files using the terminal and you will be able to see the shared file system just like a folder
	- ==EFS Mount Target==
	- #AssosiateExam You are running a high-performance database that requires an IOPS of 310,000 for its underlying storage.:
		1. You can set up replication mechanism on another ec2 instance to have a standby copy
		2. Use an instance Store
