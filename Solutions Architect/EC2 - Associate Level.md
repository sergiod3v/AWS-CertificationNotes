### Private vs Public IP - IPv4
- Dont use Elastic IP
- Random IP + DNS Name for it best practice
### Placements Groups
- Where to put EC2 Instances to be placed in infra
- Strats
	- Cluster: low-latency group in a single AZ
		- Pros: Great network (10Gbps bamdwith)
		- Cons: If AZ fails, all instances fail at the same time
		- Use cases:
			- Big Data jobs to be completed fast
			- Application that needs extremely low latency and high network
		- ![[Pasted image 20240416123440.png]]
	- Spread: spread across underlying hardware (max 7)
		- Pros:
			- Can span across AZs
			- EC2 Instances are on a physical hardware
		- Cons: Limited to 7 instances per AZ
		- Use cases:
			- Application that needs to maximize high availability
			- Critical Apps where instancs have to be insolated

	- Partition: instances across partitions within an AZ. Scales to 100s of instances
		- Up to 7 per AZ
		- Can span multiple AZ in the same region
		- Up to 100s of EC2s
		- Dont share racks with instances in other partitions
		- EC2 inside get access to the partition information as metadata
		- Use cases: 
			- HDFS, HBase, Cassandra, Kafka

### Elastic Network Interfaces
- They act as gateway for network traffic, allowing send & receive data
- Represents a _***network card:***_
	- Isolation and security between resources in the saeme physical server
	- Efficent utilization of network resources
- Following att:
	- Primari private IPv4, one more secondary IPv4
	- 1 Elastic IP per IPv4
	- 1 Public IPv4
	- A MAC Address
- Can create independetly and attach no the fly to EC2
- Bound to specific AZ

### Hibernate Instances
- Shuts down the instance
- RAM is preserved in an EBS
- EBS must be encrypted
- EBS gives data to instance when started again
- No instance store allowed
- NOT more than 60 days hibernated
