- ### NLB Layer 4:
	- Forward TCP & UDP traffic to your instances
	- Less latency -> ~100ms vs 400ms ALB
	- _**NLB has one static IP per AZ**_
	- Support assigning Elastic IP
	- not free
	- ![[Pasted image 20240422115845.png]]
	- Target Groups can be:
		- EC2 instances
		- IP Addresses - must be private
	- Health Checks support TCP, HTTP, HTTPS
	- EC2 must allow traffic from the nlb with security groups
- ### Gateway Load Balancer - Layer 3
	-  Traffic inspector so you can apply Firewalls, Intrusion Detection, Deep Packet Inspection, etc...
	- ![[Pasted image 20240422120929.png]]
	- Geneve protocol: 6081 Port
	- #### Sticky Sessions:
		-  client will use the same instance in a ALB context
		- uses "token" that expires 
		- The user doesn't lose session data
		- Cons: Imbalance the load of the ALB
		- Cookie Name
			- Application based
			- Duration Based
- #### Cross Zone Load Balancing
	- Distributestraffic to all of the registered instances across the same AZ
	- ![[Pasted image 20240422122352.png]]
	- __No charge for inter AZ data exchange__
	- NLB & GLB is nto default, but if enabled, inter AZ traffic will be charged
